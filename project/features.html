                <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>

                In short JavaScript is a scripting language which allows you to create and control dynamic website content, that means anything that moves, refreshes, or otherwise changes on your screen without requiring you to manually reload a web page. Features like: 

                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Animated graphics</li>
                    <li>Photo slideshows</li>
                    <li>Autocomplete text suggestions</li>
                    <li>Interactive forms</li>
                </ol>  
            
    
                Incorporating JavaScript improves user experience of the web page by converting it from a static page
                into an interactive one. To recap, JavaScript adds behavior to web pages.

                <h2> What Is JavaScript Used For?</h2>
                <br>

                JavaScript is mainly used for web-based applications and web browsers. But JavaScript is also used
                beyond the Web in software, servers and embedded hardware controls. Along with interactive web elements, a strong knowledge of
                JavaScript will allow you to create the following things:
                
                <br>
                <h3>Games</h3>

                If you’re interested in internet gaming and game development, you might consider using your knowledge of
                JavaScript to create your browser-based games. Although limitations are surrounding the complexity of
                browser-based games, JavaScript is as good as any other language when it comes to creating them.

                Building your simple games is also a great way to practice your JavaScript knowledge. Figuring out the
                answers to questions like “What is JavaScript used for?” isn’t always easy, but I think that the best
                way to find out exactly how versatile JavaScript can be is to try things for yourself. Download a code
                editor (I’ll touch on this again later), come up with an idea for a simple game, and put some time into
                building it.

                <br>
                <h3>Mobile Apps</h3>

                Although most mobile app development is done with operating system specific languages like Swift (iOS)
                or Java (Android), there is no reason why you can’t build apps with JavaScript. The implementation of
                frameworks like Phonegap and React Native have made it possible to create mobile apps for multiple
                operating systems using the same code. JavaScript appears to be a great choice for mobile app
                development in the future.

                <br>
                <h3>Web &amp; Server Apps</h3>

                Again, the most common answer to the question “What is JavaScript used for?” is something like ‘creating
                interactive web elements’. But this isn’t all. The creation of new libraries and frameworks is allowing
                web developers to build a lot of back-end programs with JavaScript. These include things like web apps
                and server apps. JavaScript is becoming just as essential for back-end web developers as it is for
                front-end developers.

                Note that this is by no means an exhaustive list. JavaScript is a powerful language, and most things
                will only be limited by your imagination.

            

                <h2>Why use JavaScript over other programming languages?</h2>
                Aside from the unlimited possibilities, there are many reasons for web developers to use JavaScript over
                other programming languages:

                JavaScript is the only programming language native to the web browser

                JavaScript is the most popular language

                It’s an easy and fun language to learn
