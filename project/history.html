            <p> JavaScript was born on the Internet, and came out with the advent of browsers. </p>
            <p> Looking back at JavaScript's history, we must start with the history of the browser.
                At the end of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at the European Organization for Nuclear Energy
                Research
                (CERN), invented the World Wide Web based on the Internet( the world's largest computer network),which
                was able to browse web pages online. The earliest web pages can only be viewed in the terminal of the
                operating
                system, that is to say, we can only use the command line to operate , and the web pages were displayed
                in the
                character window,which was of course very inconvenient. </p>
            <p> At the end of 1992, the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) began developing a
                standalone
                browser called Mosaic. This is the first browser in human history, from which the web page can be viewed
                in a
                graphical interface window.</p>
            <p> In October 1994, a major programmer of NCSA, Marc Andreessenï¼Œand Jim Clark who is a venture cpitalist
                organized a corporation
                Mosaic Communications, which was later renamed Netscape. This company developed a new
                generation
                of browsers,Netscape Navigator, for ordinary users based on Mosaic. </p>
            <p>In December 1994, Navigator released version 1.0 leading with a market share of more than 90%.</p>
            <p>Netscape quickly discovered that they needed a scripting language that could be embedded
                in web
                pages to control browser behavior. At that time, the network speed was very slow and the Internet access
                fee was
                very expensive, and some operations should not be completed on the server side. For example, if the user
                forgets
                to fill in the "username", he clicks the "send" button. It is a bit too late to find this on the server.
                It is
                best to tell the user "please fill in the username" before the user sends the data. This requires
                embedding a
                small program in the web page to let the browser check if each column is filled.</p>
            <p>The management's vision for this scripting language is that the functionality does not need to be
                too
                strong. The syntax is simple, and it is easy to learn and deploy. That year, just after Sun's Java
                language came
                out, the marketing campaign was very successful. Netscape decided to work with Sun to support embedded
                Java
                applets (later called Java Applet). However, there was controversy about whether to use Java as a
                scripting language.Later, Netscape decided
                not to use Java because the web applet didn't need the "heavy" syntax of
                Java.
                However, Netscape also determined that the syntax of the scripting language was close to Java and can
                support
                Java
                programs. These assumptions directly ruled out the use of existing languages such as Perl, Python, and
                TCL.</p>
            <p> In 1995, Netscape hired programmer Brendan Eich to develop this web scripting language. Brendan Eich has
                a
                strong background in functional programming and hopes to implement this new language based on the Scheme
                language (a dialect of the LISP language ).</p>
            <P> In May 1995, Brendan Eich designed the first version of the language in just 10 days. It was a
                hodgepodge
                with
                multiple sources of grammar.</P>
            <h2 id="development">Development</h2>
            <p> Netscape's browser scripting language, originally called Mocha, changed to be called LiveScript in
                September 1995.
                In
                December, Netscape and Sun (the inventor and owner of the Java language) reached an agreement that
                allowed the
                language to be called JavaScript. In this way, Netscape can leverage the power of the Java language, and
                Sun has
                extended its reach to the browser.</p>
            <p> On December 4, 1995, Netscape and Sun jointly released the JavaScript language, which promoted JavaScript
                as a
                supplement to Java. It is a lightweight Java that is designed to operate web pages.</p>
            <p>In March 1996, the Navigator 2.0 browser officially built the JavaScript scripting language.</p>
